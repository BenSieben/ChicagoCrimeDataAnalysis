Chicago Crime Data Analysis Program

Python 2.7 program which connects to a MongoDB database by using PyMongo to make specific queries on Chicago crime data obtained from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present-398a4. The data describes information about each report that includes type of crime reported, the general block of where the reported crime occurred, and whether or not an arrest was made.

Here is a breakdown of the current modules in the project:

    + crimeanalysis.py - holds main program to run
    
    + crimeanalysisconfig.py - holds constants to use in the program for configuring settings such as MongoDB connection values
